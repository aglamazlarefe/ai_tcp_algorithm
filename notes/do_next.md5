Ensure Compatibility with ns3-ai
    Verify that your custom RLAqmEnv class (not shown here) correctly interacts with Python and that it handles state-action exchanges without type mismatches.


Debugging Tips
    Python-C++ Communication:
        Check logs from both the Python and NS-3 sides to ensure the RL agent and simulation are exchanging data correctly.
        Use verbose logging for debugging the interface between Python and NS-3.

    Unit Testing:
        Isolate and test the Python DQN independently on a simpler Gym environment before integrating it with NS-3.
    Simulation Stability:
        Gradually increase the complexity of your NS-3 simulation to identify potential bottlenecks or issues.
